A simple University Website was created using HTML and CSS , I created 5 different website pages ( Home Page, About Page, Course page, Blog post page and Contact page ) link all pages through navigation menu.  In this module I learnt how to create website using html and style with CSS. I also learnt how to use bootstrap for the contact form.
